          to click F12 on a web page and start editing the CSS. This lead to an upward spiral where
          I began watching YouTube videos about this crazy thing called JQuery. As the summer went
          on I eventually took the plunge, signed up for a Web Development Bootcamp, and by December
          of that year had joined my first team.`

        Above all I value both individual & team autonomy. Product teams want to feel intrusted and
        empowered to be able to make decisions and practice their craft to the best of their
        ability.
      </li>
      <li>
        I believe in the need to have comprehensive testing up and down the codebase, as testing and
        code quality directly correlate.
      </li>
      <li>I also believe testing works best, when I write tests first.</li>
      <li>
        I believe in being agile, and believe that at present date, the best way to be agile is by
        delivering de-composed atomic units to production multiple times a day, rather than focusing
        on big overhanging deadlines, or sprints.
      </li>
      <li>
        I believe kanban has the potential to make your work tasks, and personal life tasks easier
        to achieve.
      </li>
      <li>
        I believe in people over processes. But I also believe that processes are sometimes needed
        in order to set people up for success by default, rather than failure.
